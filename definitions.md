## [Diseases and Disorders](https://www.healthwriterhub.com/disease-disorder-condition-syndrome-whats-the-difference/)

Doctors diagnose and treat a disease based on abnormalities in systemic functions, e.g. cardiovascular disease. These abnormalities can cause physical signs, symptoms, as well as pain, dysfunction, or death.

A *disorder* is a disruption of the disease to the normal or regular function in the body.

For example, a disorder resulting from cardiovascular disease is an arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is not a disease itself; it's an abnormal heartbeat that occurs as a result of having cardiovascular disease.

## [Care, Therapy, Treatment, and Intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy)

The words care, therapy, treatment, and intervention overlap in a semantic field, and thus they can be synonymous depending on context. Moving rightward through that order, the connotative level of holism decreases and the level of specificity (to concrete instances) increases.

The word *care* tends to imply a broad idea of everything done to protect or improve someone's health:

- Emergency care
- Intensive care
- Ambulatory care
- Home care
- Primary care
- Secondary care
- Tertiary care
- Follow-up care
- End-of-life care
